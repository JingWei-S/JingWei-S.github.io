## Abstract
In light of our aging population, there is an immediate need for non-obtrusive, continuous, and ubiquitous health monitoring technologies that will enable our population to age with a higher quality of life and independence. Research has demonstrated that gait indicators, such as walking speed, can reflect cognitive and physical functioning. However, gradual changes in such indicators usually go undetected until critical problems arise; being able to detect changes in indicators, such as gait deterioration, of older adults while in their home environments would enable clinicians to tailor more effective and personalized interventions by better understanding user behaviour in real-world settings. Real-world data is essential to enabling our healthcare system to act where patients most need help and to optimize the effect of designed eHealth solutions.
