I'm currently a 3rd year PhD student at [Human-Computer Interaction Group](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/hci) at the University of Melbourne. I work with [Prof. Vassilis Kostakos](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/vkostakos/index.php) and [Dr. Tilman Dingler](http://tilmanification.com/). Prior to my PhD, I obtained my Master of Applied Science (MASc) degree from University of Waterloo in 2019 and my bachelor degree from Southern University of Science and Technology (China) in 2017.

In the past, I have also done research regarding [ultrasonic sensing](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2018/3675974/) and [sleep monitoring with wearable devices](https://mhealth.jmir.org/2021/6/e26462/). 

During my PhD, my research revolves around Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) and smart speakers. As an introvert, my work is making smart speakers talk to me [proactively](https://jingwei-s.github.io/images/speaker_prototype.jpg). More recently, I'm interested in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3. I sometimes do [random sketching](https://jingwei-s.github.io/images/godzilla_fight_trump.png) with text-to-image generation models too.
