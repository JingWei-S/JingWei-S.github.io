Hi everyone! I'm currently a 3rd year PhD student @ University of Melbourne. I work with [Prof. Vassilis Kostakos](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/vkostakos/index.php) and [Dr. Tilman Dingler](http://tilmanification.com/). My research interests revolve around Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Ubiquitous Computing. I obtained Master of Applied Science (MASc) degree from University of Waterloo in 2019, where I worked on using wearable devices to monitor people's sleep health in the wild. I obtained my bachelor degree from Southern University of Science and Technology (China) in 2017. My PhD work focuses on Voice User Interface (VUI). In particular, I'm interested in making smart speakers proactive.
