I'm currently a 3rd year PhD student at [Human-Computer Interaction Group](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/hci) at the University of Melbourne. I work with [Prof. Vassilis Kostakos](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/vkostakos/index.php) and [Dr. Tilman Dingler](http://tilmanification.com/). My research interests revolve around Voice User Interface (VUI). As an introvert, my interest is making smart speakers talk to me [proactively](https://potashh.github.io/images/speaker_prototype.jpg).

I obtained Master of Applied Science (MASc) degree from University of Waterloo in 2019, where I worked on using wearable devices to monitor people's sleep health in the wild. I obtained my bachelor degree from Southern University of Science and Technology (China) in 2017.
