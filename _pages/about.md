I'm currently a 3rd year PhD student at [Human-Computer Interaction Group](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/hci) at the University of Melbourne. I work with [Prof. Vassilis Kostakos](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/vkostakos/index.php) and [Dr. Tilman Dingler](http://tilmanification.com/). My research interests revolve around Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) and smart speakers. As an introvert, my work is making smart speakers talk to me [proactively](https://jingwei-s.github.io/images/speaker_prototype.jpg).

I obtained my Master of Applied Science (MASc) degree from University of Waterloo in 2019 and my bachelor degree from Southern University of Science and Technology (China) in 2017. 

You can find my up-to-date CV [here](https://jingwei-s.github.io/files/Resume_JingWei.pdf).
